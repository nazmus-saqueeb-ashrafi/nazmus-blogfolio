This was my first experience with a [no code platform](https://www.bravostudio.app/). I did this over a few days. It was fun to just design an app in Adobe XD and watch it come to life. Even though this is a fun way of developing quick and basic apps, it is not really practical to develop a full, feature heavy application as Bravo Studio starts charging for anything involving authentication. So even though I cannot recommend it, this was a fun experience for me to see what's possible in the realm of no-code.
